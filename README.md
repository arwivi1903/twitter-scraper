Non-API Twitter Scraper


I created this extremely simple Twitter scraper for fun. 

Do not use it to get thousands of tweets per day. Use their API for that.

This it to show how curl can be used and reg expressions can be used to take out tweets and stuff.

The PHP returns it in JSON format.

Front end uses angular. Still not a pro in angular so it still requires a lot of cleaning.

Accepting all pull requests. :)
